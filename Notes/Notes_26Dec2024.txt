We have completed 1st Module
and 2nd Module

Linux is useful in many situations
	for example, Git Bash is a linux environment
	and while deploying our applications in cloud, mostly cost effective solution may be linux
	so, we will push our project to git (github/ gitlab/ bitbucket)
		and in cloud, we connect to cloud using a terminal and
		write commands in linux to pull the project, run it in cloud

How many of you already have installed GIT in your computer/ laptop?

for those who have installed git,
	can you see "git bash" in you system?
		Yes

You can practise linux commands in this "Git Bash" itself.


Linux commands

in windows, we use "dir" to see the list of files and folders along with other details
in linux, we use
	ls
	ls -l

first of all, it is showing the files and folders of which location?
you want to know what is the present working directory?
	pwd

but, we may want to work in any other specific location.
so better close this git bash and 
in windows file explorer, go to the required location


	cd
is used for change directory
	cd ..
is used to go back to parent directory or 1 level up
	mkdir
is used to to create a folder
	rmdir
is used to remove a folder
	rm
is used to remove a file

How to create a file in linux shell?
	touch one.txt

i have create a file "one.txt"
use "ls" to check

how will you write some content into the file "one.txt"?
as manikanta suggested, i use "echo"
	echo "Hello world" > one.txt

how to see the contents of a file?
	cat one.txt

in windows cmd prompt, "type" is used to see the contents of a file


how can you edit the contents of this file?
	nano

like we use "Notepad" in windows, we can use lot of
editors in linux like:
	nano
	vi

in nano editor, we can type simply and finally
we need to exit the editor.	the options are given below

^X		Use CTRL+X to exit
it may ask you the name of the file to save before exit

lets use vi editor
	vi one.txt

we have 2 modes in vi editor
	escape mode
	insert mode


escode mode
	we can issue commands
insert mode
	we can type contents in the file

currently it is in escape mode,
	i type "i" to go into insert mode

after typing work is over,
	esc		:wq


w for save
q for quite

--------------------------------------------
Versioning vs Soure code control
	Git is a version control system
	
Versioning and Source code control have minute difference
very few difference
	because, versions normally are related to the code which is build (compiled)
	but source code is before compilation

but, the concept of versoning also related to
	my version of code
	your version of code
	trace the changes in the code
	merge etc

there are 2 or more programmers, the are working on same project
each one contributes to the same project
in such cases, we need to track who has wrote which code?
trace the modifications also

mostly if you push your source code into public repositories like github,
then it becomes, Open Source


Importance of version control in a collaborative coding environment:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Coding is implemented by a team of developers
so, it is important that they should be allowed to collaborate and work on their
individual modules or share the responsibility of coding together in order to achieve their goal.

Git is also one of the DevOps technology

Git can be installed in our system
	in order to maintain local repository

What is repository?
	repository is any storage be it a directory or database or etc
	in our local system, we have a "directory"
		now, we want to sync this with a remote repository

What is a remote repository?
	a repository created in cloud like
		GitHub
		GitLab
		BitBucket

so, we are synchronizing our local directory to a directory in cloud

Basically, our remote repository (public ) is READ-ONLY
but in order to enable collaborative coding, we need to configure this repository and
	add collaborators to this repository

collaborators are invited via email
and they can accept the invite and become collaborators.


Explanation of version control and its significance.
	to ensure the accountability of the code
	and communication and traceabiliity of the code changes
	whether changed or not, which part of the code is changed
	for ex:
		if any code is newly added (we see it in green)
		if any portion of the code is deleted (we see it in red)
		old vs new
	and we can add comments to those changes also
	so that it is a means of communication between the programmers who work as team



Step-by-step guide on installing and configuring Git
-----------------------------------------------------------
 Verification of the Git installation.

download git for windows from
https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/download/v2.47.1.windows.1/Git-2.47.1-64-bit.exe

this will download the installer 
double click to install

C:\Users\rjaga>git --version
git version 2.35.1.windows.2

C:\Users\rjaga>


after installing 2.47.1

Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.19045.5247]
(c) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.

C:\Users\rjaga>git --version
git version 2.47.1.windows.1

C:\Users\rjaga>git -v
git version 2.47.1.windows.1

C:\Users\rjaga>


Which git, you want to practice?
	GitHub
		is available for public


Those who do not have account in GitHub.com,
kindly signup
	using personal email


Whenever, you choose a folder in your computer
to sync with a remote repository,
choose the folder properly.

ex:
	d:\jag

suppose this folder is created as local repository
and sync to remote repository

then
	d:\jag\ust
	d:\jag\personal
	
all these folders belongs to that remote repository
and hence
we cannot create another repository for
	d:\jag\ust
	d:\jag\personal

but 
	d:\raja
can become a new git repository

ANY SUB FOLDER, CANNOT BECOME ANOTHER REPOSITORY

	d:\jag\ust\project

project itself is pushed to a remote repository,
then
	d:\jag\ust\project\frontend
	d:\jag\ust\project\backend

frontend cannot be a new git repo
and backend cannot be a new git repo

BUT INCASE, WE HAVE NOT CREATE GIT REPO FOR "PROJECT"
then it is possible that "fronend" is sync to one repo
and "backend" to another repo




4. Basics of Git (15 mins)
   - Introduction to Git commands: init, add, commit, status.
   - Overview of the Git workflow.

Demo:
i will show you how to sync my local repository to a remote repo

what is a local repository
	a folder / directory in our system
	where .git folder (usually hidden)
	is a local repository



i have chosen a folder now
	"demo"		D:\Jag\UST\Wave4\demo

this is my local repository

lets create a remote repository
	in github.com
		after login
			click + icon
				New Repository

demo-26-dec


lets create a file in our local repository
	Readme.txt


just because, you got the URL, will you be able to push files and folders to my remote repository?



git config --global user.name yourusername
git config --global user.email youremail


the above is an one time activity and 
only when you want to change user credentials, you need to repeat these commands.


coming to our local repo
D:\Jag\UST\Wave4\demo
	go to cmd prompt in this location


D:\Jag\UST\Wave4\demo>git init
Initialized empty Git repository in D:/Jag/UST/Wave4/demo/.git/

if you are doing this command in an existing repository, then it will say:

D:\Jag\UST\Wave4\demo>git init
Reinitialized existing Git repository in D:/Jag/UST/Wave4/demo/.git/

this git init
	is the command to make our local folder as a local git repository

now, we want to add files
	git add <<filename>>
or
	git add .

. means all files in current location

the time in which we issue the 
	git add .
is noted.

though we commit and push the files later, 
the time will be remembers when it is added

git commands:
-----------------
git config --global user.name <<username>>
git config --global user.email <<email>>
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/jagasia/demo-2.git
git add .
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M jag
git push -u origin jag
git branch
git checkout <<branchname>>
git switch <<branchname>>
git status
git clone
git config --list


What is the difference between
	git clone
	git pull


clone will download the entire repo as a folder
but if you want to use pull, then you create the folder and inside the folder, you need to pull

clone is done only once
if you do again, then you are overwritting the entire folder

pull is incremental
	only those changes are pulled, so the data traffic is minimal

pull detect changes and pull those branches and files that are not present locally
	ideally, when remote repo contains files, folders that are not contained locally, we use pull
