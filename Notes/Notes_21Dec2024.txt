SDLC
What does SDLC stands for?
	Software Development Life cycle

What are the phases of SDLC?
	Requirement gathering		/ Planning
	Analysis
	Design
	Implementation
	Testing
	Deployment
	Maintenance

7 phases of sdlc

Rational Corporation	(adopted by IBM corporation)
	defines RUP

RUP	is 	Rational Unified Process

RUP defines SDLC as
	Inception			requirements gathering/ planning
	Ellaboration		analysis/ design
	Construction		coding/ implementation
	Transition
	Production


Inception:
	Planning, Requirements gathering
	conception

inception is no more customers' responsibility
we, are going to do the inception by ourselves and propose the solution to the customer

Requirement gathering
	observe the existing process
	appoint a domain expert


speed
accuracy
storage/ durability		if data is lost? how can we manage?????????????????

scalability			ability to scale to growing or reducing needs
persistence
transaction management
security			


You want to conduct a test in your school.

my software is going to 
	save your time		to evaluate the test papers, i take 1 week
	accurate			evaluation and scoring


features	->	benefits

inception is upto the point we understand that the customer needs a solution.

You need to discuss this with your team
	Analysis
		record the requirements in the form of SRS document	Software Requirement Specifications
	

Analysis vs Design
	analysis will produce a document		SRS	paragraphs
		i am going to implement these
	design is all about diagrams
		E-R diagram
		Database diagram
		UML diagrams
			user view
				use case diagram
			structural view
				class diagram
				object diagram
				package diagram
				deployment diagram
			behavioral view
				sequence diagram
				state machine diagram
				activity diagram
				interaction overview diagram

		Wireframes		UI



ANALYSIS
	ellaboration

DESIGN
	how many tables, what are they?
		normalization

	how many classes, what are they?
		attributes
		methods
			if you ellaborate the method, you get flowchart?	in uml it is activity diagram
		when is an object constructed, or destroyed?
			sequence diagram	(mentions the lifeline of objects)
		which object's which method calls method of which object
			in an order



Construction/ implementation/ coding
	
Test phase
	test cases are used to test the code

Deployment
	has been done in different ways over the period of decades
		earlier, it was developed in development computer and then 
			transitioned to production computer
		now a days, we develop, deploy and maintain the project in cloud
			by ourselves


	Project vs Product
		project is developed for a specific client		customized
		product is developed for a segment of clients and then promoted or sold
		we develop the product (targeting some segment) but not for a specific client
			example for product:		MS Office


Maintenance
	what is maintenance?
		ex:
			zoho books
				we use it to maintain out accounts book
					create expense
					create purchase order
					create invoice
			govt set some rules for invoice number format (suddenly today)
				now, zoho books is not installed in my computer at all
				it is there in cloud. So, zoho will update the rules in their 					product
				can we call it as maintenance
	how maintenance was done when we delivered the product as CD or downloads?
		patches were released
		microsoft releases software updates


product vs service
	delivering our software as a
		product
		service		(more advantages)


Product is bought
Service is subscribed

Samsung	vs Airtel

	Samsung delivers "product"			you pay only once
	Airtel delivers "service"			you pay monthly/ quarterly/ yearly


	
Adv of s/w as a service:
	up to date
	maintenance			client, you focus on your business, i take care of tech
	subscription			according to your requirement
	agility				quick provisioning (if you need to buy infra, it will take time to provision. And a head ache when de-provisioning)

Feasibility
to be able to find if it is feasible or not
	features
	time
	resource		tech, human
		if you keep one of these factors tangible, then it is mostly always feasible

What is the difference between QA and QC?
	Quality Assurance
		methods, that we follow that ensures the quality of the product being developed
		are you following the processes, that will product quality product
	Quality Control
		to find bugs, defects


		quality of the product
		quality of the process to develop the product
		quality of the quality process itself


Scrum Master
	sprint planning, 
	determining durations, and 
	outlining tasks for each cycle.
