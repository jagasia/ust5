22/7

circle has radius, diameter, circumference

ration  of circumference to the diameter is 22/7

What are the types of numbers?
	whole number
	natural number
	real number
	fractions
	unreal number
	rational number
	irrational number
	integers		negative, positive and zero
	prime
	complex




byte
short
int
long
	all the above are integer family
float		2.5f
double		3.5
	floating point numbers family




integers, fractions, real and complex


Fibonacci series
	0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34


Set theory
	{	}	i call this brackets as set brackets

{0, 1, 100, 20, 3, 45}

Set is a collection of distinct objects/ elements

Set in java
	rejects duplicates
	order of set depends on type of set
		TreeSet		is sorted
		LinkedHashSet	is ordered	(remembers the order in which elements were added)
		HashSet		order is based on hashCode() method 	(and equals() method)



Number system
	decimal
	binary
	octal
	hexadecimal


int x=20;
x=010;		//what is the value of x?		this is octal
x=0x10;		//what is the value of x?		this is hexa decimal


010	as 10		because you belief in the beginning has no meaning
BUT IN JAVA, 0 in the beginning has a meaning:
	it is OCTAL notation


what is the minumum number in an octal digit?
	0
max
	7
0
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
	these are the only possible digits in octal number system





25
	can be viewed as a number
	or 2 digits
	or 2 characters

Binary
	can anyone tell me real life example where we use binary?
		ON	OFF
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
	Between these 2, there are so many possible combinations
	can anyone tell me, how many possible combinations are there?
0 to 255 =	256 possible value


convert binary into decimal

128+ 64+ 32+ 16+ 8+ 4+ 2 +1



int	is 4 bytes		32 bit


65536	rows
256	columns


in java, data types

byte	1 byte	8 bits		11111111	 256	divide by 2 so that
			-128 to 127
short	2 bytes	16 bit		1111 1111 1111 1111		65536 possible values

	divide by 2		-32768 to 32767 

binary
octal
hexadecimal

where is hexadecimal useful?
	color codes
		Tell me, what is the color referring to	FF FF FF		White
						00 00 00 		Black
	if all three red, green, blue are equal, it will be in GREY SCALE

Color codes normally are in
	0-255	red		0-FF		FF refers to 255
	0-255	green
	0-255	blue

UNION				10 + 10 is upto 20
UNION ALL			10 + 10 is always 20
INTERSECT			common elements between 2 sets
MINUS				all elements of 1st set minus common elements with 2nd set

Venn diagram

UNION of 2 sets

1st set has 10 elements
2nd set has 10 elements
	ideally, if you union these 2 sets, how many will be there in the result?
		upto 20 elements


Logical Gates:
	NOT
	AND
	OR
	XOR
	


. Exponents and Logarithms (20 mins)
   - Properties of exponentiation.
   - Introduction to logarithms.
   - Connection between exponents and logarithms.



10 power 2	is 	100
log 100 base 10	is	2


2 power 1
2 power 2
2 power 3

factorial is another way of understand series

what is factorial of 100?
	100 * factorial (100-1)
where is factorial or similar kind of series used in real life

IPL
10 teams play across each other only ONCE

so, tell me, how many matches, each team will play

each team play with 9 other teams
	9 is the correct answer

TOTALLY how many matches will be conducted?
	9+8+7+6+5+4+3+2+1	=	


3 teams
	2+1	



a b
a c
b c

4 teams		a,b,c,d
	3 + 2 + 1		=6

a b
a c
a d
b c
b d
c d


Order of growth of
	sorting algorithms		Big O notation


what are algorithms
	searching algorithms
		linear
		binary			only on sorted list
		hashing			store data based on hashing function
	sorting algorithms
		bubble
		quick
		heap
		merge
		insertion
		





O(1) - Excellent/Best

O(log n) - Good

O(n) - Fair

O(n log n) - Bad

O(n^2), O(2^n) and O(n!) - Horrible/Worst


What is probability?
	number of time it is possible to occur	/	total number of possibilities


if i play a dice game,
	total possibilities:		0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
		7 possibilities

tell me, what is the probability of getting 6?
		1/7

in asp.net there is something called "Adrotator"
	that will ask you the number for probability	to show an ad


in programs, 
	for ex:
		PriorityQueue

we can specify a value for each element
