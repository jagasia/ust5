Exceptions
	we thrown exception object from couple of setter methods, after validating the data we found that the data input is not correct.
	but what exception we have thrown, is not precise.
	so, instead of throwing object of NumberFormatException, we are now going to create and 
		throw our own meaning exceptions

How to create user defined exception?	
	decide if we want to create
		Check exception	or
		Unchecked exception

Choose checked exception, when you do not want to allow the user to proceed by ignoring the exception
Checked exceptions cannot be ignored. 
	throws
	try-catch

Choose unchecked exception, if you consider them to either handle or leave it as unhandled
no compulsion on handling or usinig throws for unchecked exception

Lets create the following:
	InvalidEmployeeIdException
	InvalidNameException
	InvalidDateOfJoiningException



public class InvalidEmployeeIdException extends Exception	//checked exception
{
	
	public InvalidEmployeeIdException(String message)
	{
		super(message);
	}
}





public class InvalidNameException extends RuntimeException
{

	public InvalidNameException(String message) {
		super(message);
	}
	
}




throws
	informs the compiler that these exceptions are thrown inside this method
	but this method does not handle them
	the calling method is expected to handle them


throw
	is used to throw an object of exception class
	

difference:
	throws never throw anything, but informs compiler that this method throws these exceptions
	throws can specify multiple exceptions that are thrown by the method. It does not mean, throws is throwing them. No.		throw only does
